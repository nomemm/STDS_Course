# STDS Course Syllabus

*Course Title:* Statistical techniques for Data Science

*Course Description:*
The course covers both classical and non-standard statistics, applicable in a comprehensive set of
contexts, including non-parametric statistics, simulation methods, and time series analysis.

*Course Objectives:*
This course will provide an opportunity for participants to learn random variables, elementary probability,
and distributions; relevant probabilistic inequalities; Estimation, MLE, Confidence intervals. Statistical
hypotheses testing; Markov chains; Resampling, Bootstrap, Kernel density estimation; non-parametric
statistics.
